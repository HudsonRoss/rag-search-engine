RAG-Demo: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Principles in Action
License: MIT
Python

Overview
This repository serves as a practical demonstration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a powerful technique in modern AI that enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge retrieval with generative capabilities. RAG addresses common limitations in standalone LLMs, such as hallucinations and outdated information, by dynamically fetching relevant data from a knowledge base during inference.
In this project, we explore the core principles of RAG through a simple yet effective implementation. Whether you're building question-answering systems, chatbots, or knowledge-intensive applications, RAG provides a scalable way to ground AI outputs in real-world data. This demo uses vector embeddings for retrieval and integrates with popular frameworks to showcase end-to-end workflows.
Key benefits of RAG demonstrated here:

Improved Accuracy: Retrieve contextually relevant documents to inform generation.
Efficiency: Avoid fine-tuning massive models by leveraging retrieval mechanisms.
Flexibility: Easily update knowledge sources without retraining.
